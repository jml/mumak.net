  <h1>Test Doubles</h1>

  <h3>Dummy</h3>
  <p>
    Dummy objects are passed around but never actually used. Usually they are
    just used to fill parameter lists. In Python, <code>None</code> is the
    ultimate Dummy.
  </p>

  <h3>Fake</h3>
  <p>
    Fake objects actually have working implementations, but usually take some
    shortcut which makes them not suitable for production (an in memory database
    is a good example).
  </p>

  <h3>Stub</h3>
  <p>
    Stubs provide canned answers to calls made during the test, usually not
    responding at all to anything outside what's programmed in for the test. Stubs
    may also record information about calls, such as an email gateway stub that
    remembers the messages it 'sent', or maybe only how many messages it
    'sent'.
  </p>

  <h3>Mock</h3>
  <p>
    Mocks are objects that are pre-programmed with expectations which form a
    specification of the calls they are expected to receive.
