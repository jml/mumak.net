        This is a extract and <i>slight</i> rehash of something written by

      <p>
        First posted on <a href="http://blackjml.livejournal.com">my old
        livejournal</a>, this short article describes what you need to do to
        disconnect all sockets in a unit test.

        This paper was originally prepared as an introduction to Twisted for
        the Launchpad development team, and was presented in London on October
        30th, 2008. The version here has been edited a bit, but is essentially
        the same paper. Co-written with Michael Hudson.
